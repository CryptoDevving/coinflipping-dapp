## Introduction
* This is my first dApp! You can wager on whether the coin will land on the head or tail side.
* After choosing your foreside and placing a minimum bet of 0.01 ETH, you can flip the coin by calling the revealResult function on the contract.
* If you place a winning bet, you will be rewarded with a reimbursement of your investment to the contract.
* You can remove your betting position and receive your investment even before flipping the coin by completing the transaction.
